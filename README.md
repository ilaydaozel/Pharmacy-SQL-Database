# Pharmacy-SQL-Database
SQL database designed for pharmacies

Problem Definition: It helps the pharmacists to be able to control the drug traffic. The
system records the pharmacy inventoryâ€˜s operations, the drugs that are sold and the drugs that
are new in. The system saves the payment details and also it records the doctor, patient and
employee information. As mentioned in part 3, users will be pharmacists and pharmacist
assistants. The main assumption is there are a lot of drug types and a lot of pharmacies which
needs this system because there lots of patients too. We assume that a pharmacy has lots of
employees and one pharmacy takes drugs from one inventory. Our assumption is that a
pharmacy has lots of sales in a day and the pharmacy needs a database system to keep track
of all the payments. Each payment consists of one type of drug. Each pharmacy has one
inventory.
